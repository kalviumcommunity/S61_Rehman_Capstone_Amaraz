## Idea brief
The idea of this project is to develop a website that will serve as a comprehensive platform for small business owners  to manage their daily operations efficiently. It will provide features to list down all the orders of a particular day along with their prices, add the list of materials purchased and their prices, and calculate the dayâ€™s profits.

## Features

### Order Management :  
Users or owners can list out all the orders that were received that particular day along with prices .
### Inventory Management :
 Owners can add the list of raw  materials purchased for the day along with their prices. This feature will help in keeping track of the inventory and the expenses incurred for the raw materials.
### Profit Calculation : 
 At the end of the day, owners can keep track of their profits with the help of auto subtracting the cost of the raw materials from the total revenue generated from the orders. This feature will provide owners with a clear idea of their daily profits.
